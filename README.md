# acm-certificate-agent
K8s operator that automatically imports TLS certificates (such as those generated by cert-manager) into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

<br/>

## Description
The operator performs the following functions:
- Automatically imports (and maintains) SSL certificates stored as K8s Secrets (core/Secret) into ACM.
- Automatically adds annotations to ALB-enabled K8s Ingresses (networking.k8s.io/Ingress) that use HTTPS to consume ACM certificates.

For more information about to configure resources to use the agent, see **Using in K8s**, below.

<br/>


## Operator scope

acm-certificate-agent does *not* scope its activities to the namespace in which it is installed. You should not therefore install multiple copies in different namespaces on a single cluster.

A single installation will manage ACM certificate import and Ingress linking across an entire cluster. 

<br/>


## Cluster installation

acm-certificate-agent consists of two components:
- An image containing the operator
- A Helm chart containing the K8s deployment

Both must be installed to use the operator within a cluster.

### Prerequisites
You will need:
- An AWS EKS cluster with at least one node group, and the ARN associated with this cluster.
- An AWS ECR repository into which to deploy the acm-certificate-agent operator image, and the URI associated with this repository. 
- Local installations of golang, kubectl, aws-cli and helm. On Windows, these should be installed within WSL.
- Local installation of script-runner, if intending to use scripted IAM role/policy creation.

    **NOTE:** The .kubeconfig associated with the WSL kubectl is *NOT* the same as the one used in Windows. 
Verify cluster access within WSL using `kubectl config get-contexts` and, if  necessary, add the required context using e.g. `aws --region {aws.region} eks update-kubeconfig --name {cluster.name}`. 

### Procedure

1. Create an IAM role and associated policy that grants permission for the relevant ACM operations. Note the ARN of the role that is created.
   
   - Script runner can automate this task:
   
    ```
        script-runner scripts\acmCertificateAgent-prepare-config -p "cluster.arn:{CLUSTER_ARN}"
    ```

   - To do this manually, follow the instructions at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/specify-service-account-role.html using the trust policy template `scripts\_resources\acmCertificateAgent-iam-role-trust-policy.template`.

    <br/>
2. Build and push the operator image to ECR.
	
    ```sh
        make docker-build docker-push REPO_URI={REPOSITORY_URI}
    ```

    **NOTE:** On Windows, run this command within WSL.
	
    <br/>
3. Deploy the operator to the cluster.

    ```sh
        make deploy REPO_URI={REPOSITORY_URI} CLUSTER_ARN={CLUSTER_ARN} ROLE_ARN={ROLE_ARN}
    ```
    
    **NOTE:** On Windows, run this command within WSL.

    Existing worker nodes should be processed and their corresponding EC2 instance names updated automatically. You can view these names using e.g. the AWS EC2 web console or CLI.

## Using in Kubernetes

### Automating ACM certificate import

To enable ACM certificate import, you can place an annotation on either Certificate or Secret resources.

- **Certificates (cert-manager.io/Certificate)**

    To enable ACM import for a cert-manager certificate, add the following annotation to its definition:

    `acm-certificate-agent.validitron.io/enabled: 'true'`
    
    The Secret containing the actual SSL certificate associated with this Certificate resource will be automatically imported into ACM.

- **Secrets (core/Secret)**

    **NOTE**:* If the Secret is being managed by cert-manager Certificate, you should not configure the Secret directly but rather annotate the Certificate instead (see above) so that if the Secret is deleted/recreated by cert-manager, the agent configuration persists.

    To enable ACM import for a SSL certificate, add the following annotation to its definition:

    `acm-certificate-agent.validitron.io/enabled: 'true'`
    
    Set the value to false to disable ACM import. Any existing ACM certificates will *not* be removed.

<br/>

### Automating explicit ALB ingress ACM certificate assignment

**NOTE**: ALB can automatically detect the correct certificate(s) to assign to Load Balancer routes, independently of acm-certificate-agent. This may be preferable to explicitly setting the ARN using acm-certificate-agent. To use auto-configuration, simply set the certificate-arn annotation on the Ingress to an empty string (and ignore the acm agent instructions below.

```
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: ''
```

If you do want to explicitly assign an SSL certificate to an ALB Ingress (networking.k8s.io/Ingress), add the following annotation to its definition:

`acm-certificate-agent.validitron.io/enabled: 'true'`

An `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn` annotation corresponding to a compatible SSL certificate will be added to the definition provided that the following preconditions are satisfied:
- The Ingress is marked as using ALB with the annotation `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: 'alb'`.
- The Ingress is marked as using HTTPS with the annotation `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports` containing at least one entry marked 'HTTPS'.

For more information about ALB annotations/configuration see https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v1.1/guide/ingress/annotation

The agent will select the first certificate(s) that is/are capable of providing SSL to the host name(s) specified in the Ingress. If ACM contains multiple certificates that support a given domain, which certificate will be selected cannot be guaranteed. 

If the Ingress contains multiple routes that need more than one certificate to serve them, the agent will try to find all the required certificates. If one or more certificates cannot be found, the ARNs of those that have been found will be added to the annotation, and the agent will keep retrying until all the certificates can be matched.

<br/>

### Configuration options

Either or both of certificate import and ingress configuration can be disabled by configuring the acm-certificate-agent `configmap` associated with the deployment.

<br/>

## Uninstallation
Remove the operator from the cluster using:

```sh
    make undeploy CLUSTER_ARN={CLUSTER_ARN}
```

Any existing ACM certificates and resource annotations will not be removed during uninstallation and must be cleaned up manually.


<br/>

## How it works
This project uses the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It was built from a kubebuilder project and subsequently modified to use Helm.

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

To support internal book-keeping, the agent automatically adds annotations to managed Secret objects. These should not be modified.

- `acm-certificate-agent.validitron.io/certificate-arn`
- `acm-certificate-agent.validitron.io/domains`
- `acm-certificate-agent.validitron.io/expires`
- `acm-certificate-agent.validitron.io/inherits-from`
- `acm-certificate-agent.validitron.io/serial-number`

<br/>

## Debugging 
To debug the Helm chart and inspect the intermediate yaml file that is created run:

```sh
make helm-debug
```

Output will be generated as `debug.yaml`
